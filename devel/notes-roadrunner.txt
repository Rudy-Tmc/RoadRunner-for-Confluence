strategy - algorithms:
---------
- get local server page time stamps
- get remote server page time stamps




==========================================

- synchronizations are not exactly atomic, so if someone updates a page at the exact second of a synchronization it is possible that roadrunner would miss that update
- no data is ever deleted only added. 

- outline first synch flow with visio
  - wizard
    - is this a first synch?
      - get space from server

- what activities are not synched:
  ? - comments?

Description of how things work:
- when you synchronize RoadRunner looks for changes to your local system and changes to the server
since the last synch. Changes include:
    - page updates
    - pages added
    - NOT pages deleted
    - pages renamed


Update types to consider:
- page added
- page deleted
- page updated
- page renamed
- attachment uploaded
- comments added
- news added

Purpose:
RoadRunner is meant to help travellers keep an instance of Confluence on their laptops
with a personal license synchronized with a single server instance of Confluence. 

=======================
phase 1:
--------
- to synch a space you must initially do an export/import from the server
-

Feature list:
